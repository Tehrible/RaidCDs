NEWS:
    - Battle for Azeroth is here, and with it come many, MANY changes!
	
    - I'm always looking for improvements on this WeakAura. Contact me
		on Discord at Tehr#5246 or post a comment on wago.io/RaidCDs

BUGS:
	- Currently the Battle Rez Timer does not work during a
		raid encounter. Unfortunately, there's nothing I can
		do about that for now, so Battle Rezzes will no
		longer display outside of M+ dungeons
	
FEATURES:    
    - Slightly adjusted spacing on Battle Rez Timer
	- Fixed some Italian translations
